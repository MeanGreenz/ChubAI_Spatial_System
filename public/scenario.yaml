# ChubAI Spatial System - Scenario Configuration
# This file configures the spatial tracking system for your scenario

# Scenario name (displayed in search and UI)
name: Spatial Tracking Demo

# Description of this spatial system configuration
description: A demonstration of the ChubAI spatial tracking system that monitors character positions relative to the user

# Character configuration options:
# Option 1: Run without specific characters (user only)
# characters:
#   - 'self'

# Option 2: Use predefined characters by ID
# characters:
#   - 88
#   - 123

# Option 3: Use character definition files (recommended for spatial tracking)
characters:
  - '@characters/susan.yaml'  # Relative path to character definition

# Scenario override (optional)
# This text will override the scenario field for all characters
scenario: "You are in a spatial tracking environment. The system will monitor character positions relative to you (the user at coordinates 0,0)."

# Spatial system configuration
spatial_config:
  # Maximum tracking distance (coordinates will be clamped to these bounds)
  max_distance: 1000
  # Minimum tracking distance
  min_distance: -1000
  # Default coordinate system explanation
  coordinate_system: "X: Horizontal (left/right), Y: Depth (front/back), User at (0,0)"

# Example character positions for testing:
# - Susan: {x: 5, y: 10, status: "Standing nearby"}
# - Bartleby: {x: -3, y: 8, status: "Approaching from left"}
# - Boss: {x: 0, y: 15, status: "At desk ahead"}

# Notes:
# - The spatial system automatically tracks character positions from AI responses
# - Positions are relative to the user at coordinates (0,0)
# - Coordinates are validated and clamped to reasonable bounds
# - Invalid positions are logged and handled gracefully
